# Sign Language to Speech Conversion  

This project is a Python-based application that uses machine learning to translate American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into speech. It recognizes A-Z alphabets, 0-9 digits, and specific gestures for space and full stop. The tool offers a graphical user interface (GUI) with live video feed and real-time gesture recognition.  

## Features  
- **Real-time ASL Recognition**: Converts hand gestures into corresponding alphabets, numbers, or punctuation marks.  
- **Dynamic Sentence Formation**: Creates words and sentences, including support for duplicate letters.  
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Speaks out the recognized sentence with a single click.  
- **Customizable GUI**: Includes a dark theme, a live video feed, and intuitive controls for ease of use.  
- **Stabilization Mechanism**: Ensures accurate recognition of gestures.
